### Hey! ✌🏼

I'm Kyle, a senior software engineer, focusing on the frontend, based in London, UK currently working at <a href="https://github.com/thisissoon" target="_blank">SOON_</a>. 

My main dev frameworks are currently Svelte and React, and my latest project is <a href="https://www.smileaturphone.com" target="_blank">Smile At Ur Phone</a>, a site to catalogue the various reasons people smile at their phone.

I also dabble in some backend coding using Go, and I've recently ported my Tarkov TK Discord Bot from Node.js to Go.
