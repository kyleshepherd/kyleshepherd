### Hey! ✌🏼

I'm Kyle, a full stack web developer based in Cornwall, UK currently working at <a href="https://github.com/thisissoon" target="_blank">SOON_</a>. 

My main dev frameworks are currently Svelte and React, and my latest project is <a href="https://www.smileaturphone.com" target="_blank">Smile At Ur Phone</a>, a site to catalogue the various reasons people smile at their phone.
